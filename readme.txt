Easily import property listings into Realia with the Realia Add-On for WP All Import. Supports Realia theme 3.x, 4.x, and the Realia plugin.

== Description ==

The Realia Add-On for [WP All Import](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-all-import "WordPress XML & CSV Import") makes it easy to bulk import your property listings to the Realia theme in less than 10 minutes.

**Supports Realia theme 3.x, 4.x, and the Realia plugin.**

The left side shows all of the fields that you can import to and the right side displays a property listing from your XML/CSV file. Then you can simply drag & drop the data from your XML or CSV into the Realia fields to import it.

The importer is so intuitive it is almost like manually adding a property listing in Realia.

= Why you should use the Realia Add-On for WP All Import =

* Instead of using the Custom Fields section of WP All Import, you are shown the fields like Property Address, Price, etc. in plain English.

* Automatically find the property location using either the property address or the latitude and longitude.

* Import contract types, property types, locations, and amenities to Realia's property search dropdowns.

* Link your imported properties to their real estate agency, agent, and landlord. If they don’t exist yet new ones will be created.

* Easily import property images, and slider settings.

* Supports files in any format and structure. There are no requirements that the data in your file be organized in a certain way. CSV imports into Realia are easy, no matter the structure of your file.

* Supports files of practically unlimited size by automatically splitting them into chunks. WP All Import is limited solely by your server settings.
